# Langauge Modeling

Implementing a language modeling application that generates English sentence.  
Tutorial offered by [Dr. Jason Brownlee](https://machinelearningmastery.com/text-generation-lstm-recurrent-neural-networks-python-keras/).  
First working on character level modeling, with two settings: single layer LSTM and two-layered LSTM.  
(Adding one more layer increase a lot on the training time.)  
For sure the two-layer model gives better result.    

(Update 12/12/2017) Add word level LSTM implementation.  
Here's the result:
